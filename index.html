    <h1>Importance of Reading</h1>
    <p>Reading plays a vital role in personal and intellectual growth.<br> 
It is more than just a method of acquiring information—it stimulates the brain, sharpens memory, expands vocabulary, and improves focus and comprehension.<br> 
Reading regularly nurtures imagination, enhances creativity, and develops empathy by allowing readers to step into the lives and experiences of others.<br> 
It encourages curiosity and independent thinking, both of which are essential for lifelong learning.<br> 
Books offer a quiet escape from the noise of the world while also helping individuals understand complex issues, cultures, and emotions.<br> 
In today’s fast-paced digital age, where screens dominate daily life, the habit of reading is more important than ever.<br> 
Many children are increasingly drawn to social media, often at the cost of their cognitive and emotional development.<br> 
Overexposure to social media can lead to shortened attention spans, increased anxiety, and a dependence on instant gratification.<br> 
Therefore, it is crucial to foster a love for reading from an early age by making books accessible, interesting, and a part of daily life.<br> 
Encouraging children to read not only improves their academic performance but also helps them grow into thoughtful, informed, and well-rounded individuals.
